# techdegree-project10
 The 10th and last project in Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

 In this final project, we’ll use React to create a client for our existing school database REST API (that you created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer the school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, we’ll use the knowledge acquired about React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up our initial project, we'll:
* Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the app in a modular fashion.
* Use React Router to set up the routes.
* Use the Fetch API and/or a tool like Axios to fetch data from our REST API.
* Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
* Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
